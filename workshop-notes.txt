ath_18S.fasta


Get RNAstructure command working (./Fold??)

RNA SS prediction workshop
18S rRNA example
- Get phylogenetic structure to compare against
- Get reactivities for 18S rRNA from Ding.
From paper "In vivo genome-wide profiling of RNA secondary structure reveals novel regulatory features"

- Try predicting secondary structure without using constraints

- Then try it with constraints

Add documentation for the above

Do the same for ViennaRNA

Calculate sensitivity/specificity/PPVs for both
