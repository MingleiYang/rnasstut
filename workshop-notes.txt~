FoldAtlas - fix pages system
Generic titles and URLs selection
Generic hide/show system as well
Maybe do away with hidden style shiz and just add/remove elements as needed

Spinner should fade out

FoldAtlas /documentation

Load via ajax when clicked
Or with page when URL is direct

Constraints
Setting up FoldAtlas

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Use ct2dot

Then use RNAplot to do the plotting

Create some slides describing folding


- RNAstructure and ViennaRNA - comparisons of accuracy
- Improvements in accuracy when constraints are added
	

os.system(
			rnastructure_path+"/exe/Fold"+ # the program
		" "+constraints_dir+"/fragment.fasta"+ # the sequence of interest
		out_opt+ # the output filename
		constraints_opt # constraints option
	)



ath_18S.fasta


Get RNAstructure command working (./Fold??)

RNA SS prediction workshop
18S rRNA example
- Get phylogenetic structure to compare against
- Get reactivities for 18S rRNA from Ding.
From paper "In vivo genome-wide profiling of RNA secondary structure reveals novel regulatory features"

- Try predicting secondary structure without using constraints

- Then try it with constraints

Add documentation for the above

Do the same for ViennaRNA

Calculate sensitivity/specificity/PPVs for both
